### This was made to test simulating mouse and keyboard events
Must learn CPP...

# BHOP
Hold Control to spam Space (Bhopping)

# AutoClicker
Hold Numpad 1 to spam Autoclicker (delay entered at start)

# Testing
Numpad 5 to test autoclicker for 5 seconds
I dont recommend doing this as for 5 seconds your mouse will be spammed and youll probably open like 100 viruses,
I did it and reached 2000cps but IDK how viable it actually is considering it lags the mouse events
